# JetDrift
A concise toolkit for studying jet drift and Fourier-v₁ unfolding in high-energy particle collisions. This repository hosts ROOT macros, C++ code, and Python scripts to:

- Build and combine response matrices (8×32 → 5×32 bins)  
- Perform Bayes and SVD unfolding with RooUnfold  
- Analyze jet angle distributions (WTA vs. SOP axes)  
- Compute covariance matrices and visualize results
